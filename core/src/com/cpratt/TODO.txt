1. Allow for dynamic loading of levels.
    - Right now it is designed to only load bricks (blocks)
    - Means I also need to get some new asset ideas
        - Actually...nothing really needs to change if all the assets are the same size as a block (20x20)
            - I like this idea I'm keeping it
2. Add screen transitions
    - Think I Wanna Be The Guy
3. Add the ragey stuff...
4. Add player rotations and animations
    - Rotations: DONE
    - Animations: NOT STARTED
5. Consider building a collider class so collision detection doesn't need to be handled in player class
    - DONE
6. Methodize the classes. Less public variable access between classes.
7. Add player death
    - Base: DONE
